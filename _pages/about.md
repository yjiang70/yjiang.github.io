Hello!
I'm Yoyo, an undergraduate in math at Johns Hopkins University
going into my 4th year in fall 2025.
I am still developing my math interests ---
right now I particularly enjoy learning about
algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and category theory.
I organize the 
[math club and undergrad seminar](https://math.jhu.edu/~mathclub/)
at JHU.

Outside of math, I am an amateur [flutist](/music),
and I perform regularly with the Hopkins Symphony Orchestra
as well as in chamber settings.
Here is a [recording](files/reinecke.mp3) of my performance of
the first movement of Reinecke's concerto with HSO
as one of the winners of the concerto competition in spring 2022.

Here is my [CV](files/cv.pdf) (updated January 2024).
