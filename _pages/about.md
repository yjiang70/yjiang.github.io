Hello!
I am an undergraduate in math at Johns Hopkins University
going into my 4th year in fall 2025.
Currently, I am curious about
topics in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry
and category theory.
I organize the math club and undergrad seminar
at JHU (TODO: link).

Outside of math, I am an amateur flutist,
and I perform regularly with the Hopkins Symphony Orchestra
as well as in various chamber groups.
Here is a recording of my performance of
the first movement of Reinecke concerto with HSO
as the winner of the concerto competition in spring 2022
(TODO: link).

Here is my CV (TODO: link) (updated TODO).
